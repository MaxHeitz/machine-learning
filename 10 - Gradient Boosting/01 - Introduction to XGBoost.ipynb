    "The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is a project which offers public data of space observations. Observations have been made since 1998 and have been made accessible to everyone who is interested.\n",

    "For this purpose a special 2.5 m diameter telescope was built at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, USA. The telescope uses a camera of 30 CCD-Chips with 2048x2048 image points each. The chips are ordered in 5 rows with 6 chips in each row. Each row observes the space through different optical filters (u, g, r, i, z) at wavelengths of approximately 354, 476, 628, 769, 925 nm.\n",

    "The telescope covers around one quarter of the earth's sky - therefore focuses on the northern part of the sky."
