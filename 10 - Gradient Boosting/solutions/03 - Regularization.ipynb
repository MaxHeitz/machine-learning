    "A model with a high bias cannot reach the center - the center of gravity of all its arrows is on the outer part of the target.\n",
    "A model with a low bias is globally centered on the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model with a high variance is not consistant - its arrows are largely spread.\n",
    "A model with low variance is very consistant - even when its arrows are not in the right place, they are in a limited zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a machine learning algorithm, it is a *tradeoff* between Bias and Variance : we want to minimize both (low bias, low variance), but usually when one decreases the other increases.\n"
